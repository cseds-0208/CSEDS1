        <h1>global warming</h1>
<p>Global warming is the long-term increase in Earth's average surface temperature, primarily caused by human activities that release heat-trapping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. The planet's average temperature has risen by about 1.5Â°C since the Industrial Revolution, with the rate of warming more than doubling since 1981. Global warming is a component of the broader issue of climate change, which includes all the resulting long-term shifts in weather patterns and other climate system effects</p>
